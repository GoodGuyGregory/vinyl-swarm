# Vinyl Swarm

Collecting vinyl is a journey, but with so much out there, finding everything you want can be overwhelming. It's challenging too! As your collection grows, so does the difficulty of keeping track of knowing what you want and already own. I want to collect as many vinyl treasures as possible, and reduce the stress of keeping track of all my records. I also got tired of lossing lists of records I plan on purchasing at a later time. Thatâ€™s why I built this project. 

On top of that, hunting for records isn't just about what you already ownâ€”itâ€™s about discovering new places, supporting local merchants, and building a community of fellow collectors. With Vinyl Swarm, you can search for friends, share collections, and track down hidden gems together. Whether youâ€™re digging through crates at your favorite shop or mapping out new stores to explore, this app makes it easier to connect, collect, and celebrate the vinyl experience.

This backend Axum application, written in Rust, helps categorize and search your collection, so instead of racking your brain for whatâ€™s missing, you can let the system do the work.

My hope is that this API makes finding vinyl-collecting friends easier, helps you keep track of your collection, and, most importantly, helps you finally snag those rarities youâ€™ve been after. Now get out there and form your own Vinyl Swarm. ðŸŽ¶

### Features

* **User Collections:** Store your personal record collection details with the world and show off your rare finds. This also helps friends determine what records they might want to take off your hands. Collections can be viewed by others and they make great conversation starters.

* **Records:** Records are representations of actual vinyl releases. The Records collection will be stored in the database for anyone to look at and add to their collection. This is a running list of all records for every user. It's community driven.

* **Record Stores:** What app wouldn't be complete without the best havens for searching for the your next favorite artist's LP. The API allows for accessing Record Stores throughout the US, offering a description of the store and it's city state, as well as the website to browse stock.

# Getting Started


## Ensure PostgreSQL is Installed

if you have not done so [install postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) the database backend is configured to work with postgres through `SQLX`. This is leveraged to interface with postgres through the Rust API backend.

**What is SQLX?**

>   SQLX is a Rust library that provides a type-safe SQL library for Rust applications. It takes the static query strings and returns the entire SQL result set as a Rust type. It's a pure Rust library that is used for asynchronous database   handling in Rust.  

[SQLX Project](https://sqlx.dev/article/A_Beginners_Guide_to_SQLX_Getting_Started.html)

## Clone the Repo

clone this repo somewhere safe and access the code locally.

## Cargo Build

after cloning `change directory` into the project then build the project using the following dependencies with these features 

```bash
# change directory to the project
cd vinyl-swarm/vinyl-swarm

# build the project 
cargo build
```

**Dependencies Required**

```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.8.1"
bcrypt = "0.17.0"
bigdecimal = { version = "0.4", features = ["serde"] }
chrono = { version = "0.4.40", features = ["serde"] }
dotenv = "0.15.0"
serde = { version = "1.0.218", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.140"
sqlx = { version = "0.8.3", features = ["runtime-async-std-native-tls", "postgres", "chrono", "uuid", "bigdecimal"] }
tokio = { version = "1.43.0", features = ["full"] }
tower-http = { version = "0.6.2", features = ["cors"] }
uuid = { version = "1.15.1", features = ["serde", "v4"] }
```

## Initialize Database

After building the project you're ready to add the initial database files to start adding your personal collection. from inside the `vinyl-swarm` directory. 

**Create Database Configuration**

point the project to your newly created database and supply the connection string inside of a `.env` file at the `root` of the project. *ie inside the `vinyl-swarm` directory of this repo*

**Project Structure Below**

place the `.env` in the same location. This is the Vinyl-Swarm Project contents.

```tree
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ 20250308183724_init.down.sql
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ 20250308183724_init.up.sql
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ handlers
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ record_stores.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ records.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ users.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ main.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ record.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ store.rs
â”‚Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ user.rs
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ routes
â”‚Â Â      â”œâ”€â”€ mod.rs
â”‚Â Â      â””â”€â”€ router.rs
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
```

**Contents of ENV**

if you haven't already done so create a `vinyl_swarm` database with a `user` and `password` for this database then add the configuration details to your `.env` exposure of your database in postgres might be on a different port other than `localhost:5432` check your configurations within your database for trouble shooting.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<database_username>:<database_user_password>@localhost:5432/vinyl_swarm
```

**Install the SQLX CLI**

this will be used to begin using the API

```bash
# used to run the initial migration
cargo install sqlx-cli
```

**Run Initial Migration**

once the `sqlx-cli` process is installed. ensure you're inside of the project code. execute the following commands in the correct locations while your connected postgres instance is running. 


```bash
# check directory ensure `<cwd>/vinyl-swarm/vinyl-swarm
pwd

# once you've confirmed your inside the project
# run the initial migration with sqlx cli
sqlx migrate run
```

the `sqlx migrate run` will install all of your initial database tables, and collections used for the project. if you want to check out the relational database configuration checkout the [initial migration script](./vinyl-swarm/migrations/20250308183724_init.up.sql)

## Run the Project

from the terminal start up the application, but ensure the current working directory still points to `vinyl-swarm/vinyl-swarm` 

```bash
cargo run   
```

## Challenges

at first learning the style of module support for Rust was difficult. I often placed directories and modules in the wrong location or forgot to bring them inside of the project file that explicitly needed them. the Rust compiler was sharp and eager to tell me of my failed imports which made error tracking much easier to solve. I grew more fond of the structure as I progressed building the application breaking down functionality between files to separate component concerns for each model. **User**, **Records**, **RecordStores**. Then adding unique routes and handlers for these models to interact with the database and properly influence the user backend. After having students attempt to build the project I modified the wording and instructions. I also learned how to manage `git filter-repo` by reducing the size and removing documentation resources I used as references on how to start building a project of this scale in Axum and Rust. I hope you enjoy the concept and reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns.
